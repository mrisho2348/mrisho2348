My name is Mrisho Jumanne and I am a highly motivated individual with a passion for the development field. I am currently learning Python and am eager to expand my knowledge in the programming language. I am seeking opportunities to collaborate in Django Python projects and believe that working with a team will allow me to reach an advanced level.

In addition to my interest in Django Python, I am also familiar with PHP and Laravel for back-end development and JavaScript for front-end development including jQuery, Ajax, and VueJS. I am confident that my skills and enthusiasm will make me a valuable addition to any project.

I am eager to continue learning and growing in my career as a developer and am open to new challenges and opportunities. Thank you for your consideration.
